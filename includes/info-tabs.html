    <h2>Celeb-friendly glamazon hotel with a tri-level bar and an indoor-outdoor pool overlooking the Empire State Building</h2>
    <h3 class="tenor">The Look</h3>
    <p>
    The three-story atrium lobby shows off with manly, herringbone granite floors, black-and-white plaid wingback chairs and a mod fireplace lit by towering amethyst chandeliers. The unabashed glamour continues in the bars, which drip crystal and marble, with a side of sass — think chartreuse side chairs and Technicolor Pop Art.
    </p>

    <h3 class="tenor">Bed &amp; Bath</h3>
    <p>
    The guestrooms and suites have floor-to-(high)-ceiling panoramas of the city, but even that can’t detract from interior designer Andi Pepper’s wild decorative fantasies, from chrome-framed headboards to fuchsia curtains and cobalt throws. Deborah Anderson’s sensual photographs up the hotel’s highly erotic charge, as do the bathroom’s deep soaking tubs. Tech amenities reign, with flat-screen HDTVs and Bowers and Wilkins sound systems that (upon request) come with hotel iPods loaded with apps, local info and a custom playlist.
    </p>

    <h3 class="tenor">Beyond</h3>
    <p>
    High above the street, the heated indoor-outdoor rooftop pool and trilevel bar add some serious wow factor, with unobstructed views of the Empire State Building. The glass floors protruding over Park Avenue offer a bird’s-eye view of the city’s chaos. And as the handsome wait staff delivers fruity cocktails poolside, even in winter, the extravagant and ornate cornices of neighboring buildings come to life. Recover the next day with a yoga class or spa treatment at the Exhale gym and spa.
    </p>

    <h3 class="tenor">In the Area</h3>
    <p>
    Walk your credit cards two blocks west and then north on Fifth Avenue, home to affordable chain stores, designer flagships and such tony department stores as Bergdorf Goodman, Henri Bendel and Tiffany. While you’re up there, grab lunch at the Modern before heading next door for an afternoon at the Museum of Modern Art. Six blocks from the hotel is Mario Batali’s sprawling monument to Italian food, Eataly, as well as some of the city’s best burgers and shakes at Shake Shack, in Madison Square Park.
