    <h2>Celeb-friendly glamazon hotel with a tri-level bar and an indoor-outdoor pool overlooking the Empire State Building</h2>
    <h3 class="tenor">The Look</h3>
    <p>
    The three-story atrium lobby shows off with manly, herringbone granite floors, black-and-white plaid wingback chairs and a mod fireplace lit by towering amethyst chandeliers. The unabashed glamour continues in the bars, which drip crystal and marble, with a side of sass — think chartreuse side chairs and Technicolor Pop Art.
    </p>

    <h3 class="tenor">Bed &amp; Bath</h3>
    <p>
    The guestrooms and suites have floor-to-(high)-ceiling panoramas of the city, but even that can’t detract from interior designer Andi Pepper’s wild decorative fantasies, from chrome-framed headboards to fuchsia curtains and cobalt throws. Deborah Anderson’s sensual photographs up the hotel’s highly erotic charge, as do the bathroom’s deep soaking tubs. Tech amenities reign, with flat-screen HDTVs and Bowers and Wilkins sound systems that (upon request) come with hotel iPods loaded with apps, local info and a custom playlist.
    </p>

    <h3 class="tenor">Beyond</h3>
    <p>
    High above the street, the heated indoor-outdoor rooftop pool and trilevel bar add some serious wow factor, with unobstructed views of the Empire State Building. The glass floors protruding over Park Avenue offer a bird’s-eye view of the city’s chaos. And as the handsome wait staff delivers fruity cocktails poolside, even in winter, the extravagant and ornate cornices of neighboring buildings come to life. Recover the next day with a yoga class or spa treatment at the Exhale gym and spa.
    </p>

    <h3 class="tenor">In the Area</h3>
    <p>
    Walk your credit cards two blocks west and then north on Fifth Avenue, home to affordable chain stores, designer flagships and such tony department stores as Bergdorf Goodman, Henri Bendel and Tiffany. While you’re up there, grab lunch at the Modern before heading next door for an afternoon at the Museum of Modern Art. Six blocks from the hotel is Mario Batali’s sprawling monument to Italian food, Eataly, as well as some of the city’s best burgers and shakes at Shake Shack, in Madison Square Park.

                      <div class="review-text" data-full-text="First of all, if you go to a 5* hotel you have different expectations than a 4* hotel. This hotel is really good, but being a 5* hotel, there are some improvement points.<br/><br/>The room (executive room - Traviata) is really beautiful, very good bed, beautiful bath, 'old' mirror the room, closet. The hotel as such has a magnificant vibe, if you see the pictures, you see that the hotel as such is worthy of 5 stars.<br/><br/>We arrived quite early (10AM), our room was not yet available (we specifically asked for the Traviata, there was another room in the same category available upon arrival, which we didn't take), but the room was ready around 1PM. The hotel is a 10 min walk from piazza san babila, which takes you to the via montenapoleone (fancy shopping) or the cso vit. emmanuele II (regular shopping) and the metro (red line).<br/>From the moment of arrival, our bags were taken care of and it arrived in our room. The woman at the reception, was polite, but nothing more, a warm 5 star smile was maybe too much for her. Maybe she lacks a bit the English knowledge for being very friendly, in many other 5 star hotels the people at the reception look very very happy when you arrive of ask something, this woman looked not very happy at all, however she was polite and correct, but I didn't get a warm feeling when talking to her (which you should get if you pay 350€ a night).<br/><br/>The room didn't look spacious, because there was so many stuff in it, a bath, beautiful mirror, closet, and in the end, you see that the room is big and very gorgeous. <br/>However there were 2 negative points, the actual bathroom (the bath itself was located in the room) was very small, so there could only be 1 person in front of the mirror. Secondly, there was no power socket in the bathroom, which made my girlfriend not happy as she wanted to curl her hair before going to dinner, but couldn't do that in front of a mirror (also the power socket under the second mirror in the room itself didn't work).<br/><br/>I've additionally booked some rose pallets (30€ is a lot, but what do you expect in 5 star hotels), and it was done really nicely.<br/><br/>The bar tender (Josto I think) was really friendly (I was also the only person in the bar in the late evening...) and served me some excellent rosé champagne.<br/><br/>All by all I was satisfied by the stay, however I expected something more, the actual 5 star feeling when I enter or leave the hotel.<br/>Furthermore, there was no one in the hotel, the lobby and bar are not big, and I've only seen 2 other hotel guests, which make the hotel not really vivid.<br/><br/>(note that I did not had any problem with people hanging out in front of the hotel waiting for the soup kitchen to open)<br/><br/>In the end, I think there are better 5 star hotels in milan which are also better located (direct at Duomo or in the Quadrilatero d'Oro), however for hotels like the Park Hyatt, Bulgari, Four Seasons or Armani, you pay minimum 150€ more per night.">

Second duration for the 2nights we requested a 3rd floor room which we were given, it also faced the road at the front of the hotel, we were lucky as the noise from other guests was thankfully absent. Ask for the 3rd floor when reserving  a room facing the front of the hotel. Do not feel forced to eat at the hotel restaurant as there are many restaurants close by. We ate in the dining room the first night as we were not familiar with Milan. It was very very expensive the quality of food average, the service excellent. The staff are polite and helpful. We would stay here again. Choose a King Executive room as the best combination although rooms are quite small.">
